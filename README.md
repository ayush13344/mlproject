📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning–powered web application that predicts student performance based on demographic, socio-economic, and academic factors. Users input student details through a web form, and the trained ML model returns a predicted score or performance outcome.

The application is built using Python, Flask, and Machine Learning, following a clean separation of concerns between data handling, model inference, and web interface.
🧠 Problem Statement

Educational institutions often want to understand how different factors such as:

Gender

Parental education

Lunch type

Test preparation

Subject-wise scores

influence overall student performance.

This project helps:

Predict student performance

Analyze impact of different features

Demonstrate end-to-end ML deployment
